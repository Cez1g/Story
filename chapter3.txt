I take back everything I said It got very bad, its a total desaster. It was very unexpected and sudden. Don't go by here! We believed, them.... Greater paws had turned into a dark shade of black. Before anything it almost seemed like things were not okay... almost like all dogs knew something was going to happen. Up until the week before everything happend they became distant. They didn't talk much. But it was all to late. 
-- the end.
